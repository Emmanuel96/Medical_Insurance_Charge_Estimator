# Medical Insurance Charge Estimator

**Aim:** Build A Python Regression models to estimate medical insurance charge. Compare between model accurracy

## Project Description

Medical insurance is becoming more of a neccessity as awareness keeps rising. Inorder for an insurer to charge the customer, he would have to consider a few factor for example, smokers are more liable to lung cancer and hence are normally charged more. The number of factors that are needed to be considered makes the insurance charge a bit difficult to figure out, hence estimator models trained with regression algorithms would go a long way to provide value for such companies.
